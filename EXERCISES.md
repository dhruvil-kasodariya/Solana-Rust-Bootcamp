# Exercise 2
## 1) How many validators are there currently ?

### Total Validators:
There are currently 2,374 validators on the Solana network. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.

### Current Validators:
Out of the total, 1,394 validators (58.72%) are active and fully participating in the validation process. These validators are in sync and are contributing to the network’s consensus.

### Delinquent Validators:
980 validators (41.28%) are marked as delinquent, meaning they are currently offline or out of sync with the network. Delinquent validators aren't actively contributing to consensus, but they may come back online later.


## 2) What is special about this block?

### Genesis Block:
Block 0 is Solana's very first block, meaning it represents the beginning of the Solana blockchain. It's historically significant because it marks the point when the Solana network was launched and became operational.


## 3) What is special about this address
The address provided, 1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111, is a special address known as the Incinerator on the Solana network.
### Why Is This Address Special?
The Incinerator is a special account used in Solana for burning tokens. When tokens are sent to the Incinerator address, they are effectively destroyed, or "burned," and can no longer be recovered.

This address might be used by applications or the Solana protocol itself to manage token supply by permanently removing tokens from circulation.
## 4) What is this transaction doing ?
## 5) What is the largest balance you can find in an account ?
## 6) What advantages will the end user see when using Solana compared to other blockchains ?
