# Exercise 2
## 1) How many validators are there currently ?
at 6th November 2024
### Total Validators:
There are currently 2,374 validators on the Solana network. Validators are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.

### Current Validators:
Out of the total, 1,394 validators (58.72%) are active and fully participating in the validation process. These validators are in sync and are contributing to the network’s consensus.

### Delinquent Validators:
980 validators (41.28%) are marked as delinquent, meaning they are currently offline or out of sync with the network. Delinquent validators aren't actively contributing to consensus, but they may come back online later.


## 2) What is special about this block?

### Genesis Block:
Block 0 is Solana's very first block, meaning it represents the beginning of the Solana blockchain. It's historically significant because it marks the point when the Solana network was launched and became operational.


## 3) What is special about this address
https://explorer.solana.com/address/1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111

The address provided, 1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111, is a special address known as the Incinerator on the Solana network.
### Why Is This Address Special?
The Incinerator is a special account used in Solana for burning tokens. When tokens are sent to the Incinerator address, they are effectively destroyed, or "burned," and can no longer be recovered.

This address might be used by applications or the Solana protocol itself to manage token supply by permanently removing tokens from circulation.
## 4) What is this transaction doing ?

This transaction is a burn transaction that removes a substantial quantity of SOL from circulation. By transferring SOL to the Incinerator, these tokens are destroyed.

## 5) What is the largest balance you can find in an account ?
Solana uses a 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64) to store token balances in SPL token accounts. This means the maximum possible balance is (2^64) - 1, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 smallest units (lamports for SOL). In terms of SOL, this maximum balance is 18.446 billion SOL.

## 6) What advantages will the end user see when using Solana compared to other blockchains ?

### High Speed 
Solana handles thousands of transactions per second, offering near-instant finality. This speed is ideal for applications needing quick interaction, like DeFi and gaming.

### Low Fees 
Transaction fees on Solana are extremely low, often less than a cent, making it affordable and accessible for users, even during peak network times.

### Scalability with Proof of History (PoH)
Solana’s PoH combined with Proof of Stake (PoS) allows for efficient scaling, maintaining speed and low costs even with high demand.

### User Experience
Solana's minimal lag and high throughput give users a smooth, almost web-like experience.

### Expanding Ecosystem 
A growing range of dApps and services on Solana enables seamless movement within its ecosystem, enhancing utility and access for users.
